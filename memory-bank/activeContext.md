# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Resolving UI/UX issues, specifically focusing on responsive design and icon rendering.
- Currently addressing Font Awesome icon display problems across multiple Vue components.

## Recent Changes

- Updated Font Awesome icon classes in `AddNew.vue`, `StudentList.vue`, and `Dashboard.vue` from old `fa fa-*` to new `fas fa-*` syntax to match Font Awesome v6.5.1 CDN.
- Adjusted CSS selectors in these components to correctly style the updated icon classes.
- Previous work involved making `StudentList.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, and `AddNew.vue` more responsive by removing fixed widths and applying flexbox/grid layouts with media queries.

## Next Steps

- Verify with the user that the icon rendering issue is resolved on `AddNew.vue`, `StudentList.vue`, and `Dashboard.vue`.
- Continue with making other pages responsive, likely `WelcomeStudentForm.vue` and `ThankYou.vue` as per previous conversation flow.
- Update other memory bank files with more comprehensive project details as they become clear or are worked on.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring consistent Font Awesome usage (v6 syntax) across all components.
- Prioritizing responsive design for all key application views.
