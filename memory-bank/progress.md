# Progress

## What Works

- Student information submission form (`WelcomeStudentForm.vue`) functional, posts to `/student`.
- `/thank-you` page displays after submission.
- Admin student list (`StudentList.vue`) displays students.
- Student deletion with success/error toasts in `StudentList.vue` (toast placement and responsiveness improved).
- `Dashboard.vue`, `StudentList.vue`, and `AddNew.vue` have had initial responsiveness improvements.
- Font Awesome icons in `Dashboard.vue`, `StudentList.vue`, and `AddNew.vue` should now be rendering correctly after class and CSS updates.

## What's Left to Build

- Full responsiveness for `WelcomeStudentForm.vue` and `ThankYou.vue`.
- Further refinement of responsiveness for all pages based on user feedback.
- Comprehensive population of memory bank files.

## Current Status

- Actively working on UI/UX refinements, focusing on responsiveness and resolving display bugs (like icon rendering).
- Core functionality for student data submission and viewing is in place.

## Known Issues

- User needs to verify if the Font Awesome icon fix applied to `AddNew.vue`, `StudentList.vue`, and `Dashboard.vue` has resolved the display issues (icons showing as squares).
- General UI responsiveness across all pages is an ongoing task and may require further iterations.
